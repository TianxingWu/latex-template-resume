A Small Gift: gpa.m

A matlab code which can help you work out your gpa with PKU, USTC and SJTU algorithm.

All you need to do are as follows:

1. Write a n-by-2 matrix into "score.xls"; where, the first column contains the scores of your n courses and the second column is the credits of these courses

![Example](https://github.com/Arsennnic/latex-template-resume/raw/master/score-and-credit-example.png)

2. Put "score.xls" in the same directory with "gpa.m"

3. Run "gpa.m" in Matlab
